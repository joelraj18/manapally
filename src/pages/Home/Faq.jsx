    a: 'Yes, add computer opponents to any open seat in your room, or premium AI opponents if you have a Claude API key',

    q: 'Can friends join my room?',
    a: 'Yes, share your six character room code and friends anywhere join from the lobby with Join room, then chat with the table while you play',

    q: 'How long does a match last?',
    a: `A match is ${TOTAL_MATCH_TURNS} completed turns shared by the whole table, AI turns resolve in a couple of seconds so most of the time is yours to plan`,

    q: 'How much time do I get on my turn?',
    a: 'As long as you like before you roll, then 10 seconds after your move to build houses and hotels before the turn passes on, or press End turn to finish sooner',

    q: 'What if I lose my connection or close the tab?',

  {
    q: 'Can I trade with other players?',
    a: 'Yes, at any time, even on another player\'s turn or from Jail, offer any mix of properties, cash and Get Out of Jail Free cards, both sides must give something, buildings must be sold before a colour family is traded, and a mortgaged property costs its new owner 10% of the mortgage straight away or the full payoff',

  {
    q: 'How is the winner decided?',
    a: `The highest total net worth wins, cash plus the value of every property held, when all ${TOTAL_MATCH_TURNS} turns are played, when every other player is bankrupt, or when everyone at the table agrees to end the game`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I play on my phone?',
    a: 'Yes, the layout adapts to any screen and on narrow phones the board scrolls sideways so every space stays readable',

    a: 'Tap the speaker button at the top of the home page or the game to open the sound panel, music and sound effects each have their own switch and volume slider',
